== PURPOSE ==

The jslectureplanner package facilitates the generation and managment
of university course material. It provides an interface to set up and
access centralized course data that can be reused in all course documents.
Furthermore, the package is able to calculate the session dates of
a whole semester and generate course programs, if the course is held
weekly and the date of the first lecture is specified. Moreover,
the package can be used to generate a sectioned course bibliography
via biblatex.

* jslectureplanner.sty (the LaTeX package)
