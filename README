==================================================================

== PURPOSE ==

The jslectureplanner bundle facilitates the generation and managment
of university course material. It provides an interface to set up and
access centralized course data that can be reused in all course documents.
Furthermore, it is able to calculate the session dates of a whole semester
and generate course programs, if the sessions follow at regular intervals
and the date of the first session is specified. Moreover, it can be used
to generate a sectioned course bibliography via biblatex.
Next to the main, title-giving package, the bundle includes a package
that helps generating course member and presence lists.

The package consists of the following files:

* jslectureplanner.sty (the main LaTeX package)

* cologne.lps (German style file attempted at the Univ. of Cologne)
