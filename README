==================================================================

== PURPOSE ==

The jslectureplanner package facilitates the generation and managment
of university course material. It provides an interface to set up and
access centralized course data that can be reused in all course documents.
Furthermore, the package is able to calculate the session dates of
a whole semester and generate course programs, if the sessions follow at
regular intervals and the date of the first session is specified.
Moreover, the package can be used to generate a sectioned course
bibliography via biblatex.

* jslectureplanner.sty (the LaTeX package)
