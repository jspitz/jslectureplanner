==================================================================

== PURPOSE ==

The jslectureplanner package facilitates the generation and managment
of university course material. It provides an interface to set up and
access centralized course data that can be reused in all course documents.
Furthermore, the package is able to calculate the session dates of
a whole semester and generate course programs, if the course is held
weekly and the date of the first lecture is specified. Moreover,
the package can be used to generate a sectioned course bibliography
via biblatex.

* jslectureplanner.sty (the LaTeX package)
* german-default.lps (German style file)

== CHANGES ==

* V. 0.9 (forthcoming):  - Add a way to adjust the interval between two sessions
                           ('interval' package option and \LecInternal macro).
                         - Add a way to shift session dates from the regular
                           interval (\SetLecOffset).
                         - Rename option 'weeks' of the \SetBreaks macro to 'units'
                           ('weeks' still works, but is marked deprecated).

* V. 0.8 (2015-01-17):   - Fix corruption of \today.
                         - Add framework for different styles.
