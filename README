==================================================================

== PURPOSE ==

The jslectureplanner bundle facilitates the generation and managment
of university course material. It provides an interface to set up and
access centralized course data that can be reused in all course documents.
Furthermore, it is able to calculate the session dates of a whole semester
and generate course programs, if the sessions follow at regular intervals
and the date of the first session is specified. Moreover, it can be used
to generate a sectioned course bibliography via biblatex.
Next to the main, title-giving package, the bundle includes a package
that helps generating course member and presence lists.

The package consists of the following files:

* jslectureplanner.sty (the main LaTeX package)
* jsmembertable.sty (LaTeX package to generate course member and presence lists)

* cologne.lps (German style file attempted at the University of Cologne)
* jslectureplanner.pdf (documentation)
* jslectureplanner.tex (documentation source)
* README (this very file)

The following example files are included:

* metadata.tex: example metadata file

                         - Recode manual in utf8.

                         - Add possibility to enter exam dates that are not added to
                           the standard program (option exam of \NewSession).
		           Also add macros to display them separately (\makeexamprogram,
		           \makebeamerexamprogram) and to access their session number
                           (\examsesno).
                         - Switch input format of \LecStartDate to ISO (YYYY-MM-DD).
                           The old format (DD/MM/YYYY) is still supported for backwards

                           \SessionBlockNumber{<session no>} and \AdjSessionBlockNumber).
                         - Add unstyled date formats which allow preceding \DTMsetdatestyle
                           (the short and long date formats would override such settings).
                         - Add support for lecture and session start time, duration and thus
                           also end time calculation.
                         - Add support for displaying the next semester (\adjsemester and
                           \adjsemesterverb).

* V. 1.7 (2018-12-14):   - Allow options in \makebeamerprogram also with blocksonly.

                         - Add package option "sestitlesep" and macro \SessionTitleSep that
                           allow for the definition of a global session title-subtitle
                           separator.

* V. 1.4 (2016-10-19):   - Add instructor short forms for lecture and session.

                         - Add starred version of \sesinstructor that only produces output
                           if the session instructor differs from the general course instructor.

                         - All short{instructor|title} macros now output the long version if no
                           short form was defined.
